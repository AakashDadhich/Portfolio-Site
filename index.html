												</p>
												
												<h4>Background</h4>
												<p>
													If you're unfamiliar with the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/" target="_blank">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>, the premise
													is to host your CV online using a cloud hosting platform. From this point, you slowly bolt on more and more cloud features, until you've
													familiarised yourself with some of the most common cloud services for your chosen cloud platform. 
												</p>
												<p>
													Although I'd reviewed clients' cloud configurations as a penetration tester, I hadn't had much exposure to configuring and deploying 
													cloud services during my career. Achieving the Associate Cloud Engineer certification for Google Cloud in 2023 piqued my interest in cloud 
													security, and with this being my first foray into Amazon's cloud offering, this challenge felt like the perfect way to upskill in a 
													new technology while practising my coding skills.
												</p>

												<h4>Proof of concept</h4>
												<p>
													As mentioned above, the challenge has you create the foundational building blocks first, and this starts with converting your resume into HTML
													and building out a static website hosted in Amazon S3. While I wanted to improve my core coding skills, web design was not the skillset I was focused
													on displaying; to save time and deploy a pretty yet responsive website, I used a portfolio template courtesy of <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a>
													and modified to my liking before uploading the files to an S3 bucket. 
												</p>
												<p>
													I then used Amazon CloudFront to configure a distribution in order to allow access via HTTPS, and Amazon Route 53 to configure the DNS settings 
													to serve the contents of the bucket using a custom domain name. In order to resolve a browser warning upon loading the site, I had to use the AWS 
													Certificate Manager to generate a custom SSL certificate for my domain name. At this point, I found that I had to include the 'https://www.' 
													prefix when trying to navigate to my site or else it wouldn't resolve, but I overcame this by re-generating the SSL certificate for both the root domain and all its subdomains 
													through the use of a wildcard (e.g. *.domain.com), and re-configuring my CloudFront distribution to force all access through HTTPS only - a simple tickbox that I 
													had missed during the initial setup. 
												</p>
												<p>
													Now that I had my frontend served reliably over HTTPS using a custom domain name, I had to create a backend to store the value for a website view counter. 
													This led me to creating a Python-based Lambda to act as an API. This API would be called on website load to retrieve the value from within a DynamoDB table, 
													which was then displayed on the frontend using a small piece of JavaScript code.
												</p>

												<h4>CI/CD</h4>
												<p>
													I chose to use GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipeline since I was already using GitHub for version control. The behaviour I was hoping to achieve was: upon 
													pushing local code to GitHub, it would automatically upload my repo into the S3 bucket, thus updating my live website. Whilst researching how to achieve 
													this, I learned of the GitHub Marketplace where I found the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/s3-sync" target="_blank">S3 Sync</a> Action. I followed the simple 
													instructions in order to utilise this within my project, and it successfully uploaded my files to my S3 bucket! This may have kickstarted an obsession with 
													automation...
												</p>
												
												<h4>Transforming infrastructure into code</h4>
												<p>
													Having completed both the frontend and backend aspects of the proof of concept using the Amazon Web Console, the next step is to transform this infrastructure 
													into code, using the aptly named term 'infrastructure-as-code' (or IaC for short). I have chosen to learn Terraform in order to implement this, as it's a widely used 
													technology and will help my transition into a DevOps Engineering role in the future. This has also allowed me to become familiar with the AWS CLI, as well as 
													best practices for setting up an IAM user group and user to provide Terraform the necessary permissions to deploy infrastructure.
												</p>
												<p>
													This project is still ongoing, albeit in its final stages, as I upskill in Terraform and slowly test my code in a separate repository to ensure it is 
													mirroring the infrastructure I have created already. While I am aware that there is an import feature within Terraform, I am trying to learn to make 
													the infrastructure from 'scratch' (and also using modules where it makes sense to). This section of the post will be updated as soon as the project has completed!
												</p>
												<h4>Lessons learned</h4>
												<p>
													I've developed my skills a lot during this project, from practising Python & JavaScript, to deep-diving into the configuration of AWS services. However, the most 
													important lesson I learned was to avoid reinventing the wheel. By using existing solutions for tasks like creating websites or automating jobs 
													with GitHub Actions, I sped up the process and focused on deploying side projects faster. This approach also aligns with good business practices, i.e. using 
													programming modules or security templates to make developers use best practices and to ensure compliance with security regulations.
												</p>
												<p>
													Previously, I would try to master an entire topic before starting a project, which was time-consuming and often led to incomplete projects. This time, 
													I used ready-made templates where appropriate, allowing me to focus on the skills I wanted to develop. I realised I don't need to learn everything 
													from scratch; I can leverage my existing technical skills and experience to adapt and complete tasks efficiently. I'm excited to finish this project 
													and move on to the next one!

													<i>Shell Scripting on Linux</i>
												</div>
												<br>
												<center><img src="images/PBS-thumbnail.png" alt=""></center>
												<p>
													As a penetration tester, I spent a lot of time in the command line interface, working with shell-based tools 
													and constantly completing repetitive actions, such as creating directory structures or parsing important info from large tool outputs. 
													I decided to build some short scripts to streamline my workflow.
												</p>
												<h4>NSE Library Search</h4>
												<p>
													Nmap, a popular port-scanning tool, is a staple in any pentester's toolkit. Nmap has a huge repository of Lua scripts at its 
													disposal, and often the junior members I mentored would forget where these were stored, or what each script did. I created a 
													short and sweet shell script to speed up the searching process. You can <a href="https://github.com/AakashDadhich/NSE-Library-Search" target="_blank">
														view it on GitHub here</a> and see the example usage and output. 
													
												</p>
												<h4>Testssl.sh Parser</h4>
												<p>
													Testssl.sh was also a staple when I needed to check the security posture of a site's SSL certificate. The nature of the tool's output 
													meant that there were many log files to view when you had a large scope of sites to assess, so I created a shell script to recursively parse all the 
													log files in the directory that the tool was ran in, and output which hosts were affected by which misconfigurations. This code never left 
													the draft state and followed absolutely no best practices, but it served a purpose and was a huge time-saver! 
												</p>
												<p>
													I'm currently in the process of rewriting this far more efficiently, using Python's CSV library to parse the CSV output files from testssl.sh, 
													rather than using grep to search through the log files, but you can view it <a href="https://github.com/AakashDadhich/Testssl.sh-2-Text" target="_blank">
														on GitHub here</a>. 
													
												</p>
												<h4>Directory Structure Creation</h4>
												<p>
													This is just a simple script that I used at the beginning of each new security assessment to build out a folder structure so I could neatly 
													save my output files in an organised way. For example, it creates folders for Burpsuite, Nmap, Testssl and screenshots. Within 
													the Nmap folder are three child folders, for TCP, UDP and Fast scan outputs to be stored in respectively. 
												</p>
												<p>
													The reason this was so effective was because I set an alias to run the script which took two arguments: the name of the engagement and the month. 
													This created an easily memorable structure within my Documents sorted by client name, and then by date just by simply running 
													"pentest [client] [month]"! You can <a href="https://github.com/AakashDadhich/New-Pentest-Directory" target="_blank"> view it on GitHub here</a>.

												<h2>Discord Bot - Dungeon Crawler</h2>
												<div align=right>
													<i>Node.js, Discord.js</i>
												</div>
												<br>
												<center><img src="images/DDC-thumbnail.png" alt=""></center>
												<h4>Background</h4>
													<p>
														Created with a partner during 2018's LincolnHack hackathon, we took inspiriation from "Twitch Plays Pokemon" but with our own twist. 
														We used the Discord Bot API to create a Dungeon Crawler where people in the server react to a message to control the player on a 
														procedurally generated map. You can <a href="https://github.com/AakashDadhich/DiscordPlaysDungeonCrawler" target="_blank"> view the project on GitHub here</a>.
													</p>
												<h4>The project</h4>
													<p>
														The project was made using Node.js and Discord.js. Using a Discord bot, a map is procedurally generated along with items and enemies 
														using emojis. The bot also posts a message once the map has been generated, which checks for reactions on said message - these are to 
														control the player character. Once the first reaction is received, a 5 second timer starts and the highest count of reactions wins 
														and that direction is taken. 
														<center><img src="images/DDC-1.png" alt="" width="600px" height="auto"></center>
													</p>
													<p>
														When a player runs into an item or an enemy, that enemy's movement is frozen and it is forced to fight. There is a health and score 
														system too, where the player can choose to 'run into' enemy until it is dead, and will be granted score - or they can run around the 
														map collecting items which also adds to score.
														<center><img src="images/DDC-2.png" alt="" width="600px" height="auto"></center> 
													</p>
													<h4>Lessons learned</h4>
													<p>
														Managing to create this whole project within a 24 hour window was really challenging. It was my first time ever using JavaScript in 
														depth, and using Node.js introduced me to server side programming; we used Node.js so that we'd be able to communicate with the Discord API 
														and be able to alter and update the map. It was also one of my first times collaboratively using GitHub, and we used the GitKraken GUI 
														this time. It made the experience really streamlined and easy to use, and easy to fix merge conflicts.
