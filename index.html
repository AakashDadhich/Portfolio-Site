												</p>
												
												<h4>Background</h4>
												<p>
													If you're unfamiliar with the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a>, the premise
													is to host your CV online using a cloud hosting platform. From this point, you slowly bolt on more and more cloud features, until you've
													familiarised yourself with some of the most common cloud services for your chosen cloud platform. 
												</p>
												<p>
													Although I had been reviewing clients' cloud configurations as a penetration tester, I hadn't had much exposure to configuring and deploying 
													cloud services during my career. Having achieved the Associate Cloud Engineer certification for Google Cloud in 2023, this was my first foray 
													into Amazon's cloud offering, and this challenge felt like the perfect way to upskill in a new technology and practise my coding skills.
												</p>

												<h4>Proof of concept</h4>
												<p>
													As mentioned above, the challenge has you create the foundational building blocks first, and this starts with converting your resume into HTML
													and building out a static website hosted in Amazon S3. While I wanted to improve my core coding skills, web design was not the skillset I was focused
													on displaying; to save time and deploy a pretty, yet responsive website, I used a portfolio template courtesy of <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML UP</a>
													and modified to my liking before uploading the files to an S3 bucket. 
												</p>
												<p>
													I used Amazon CloudFront to configure a distribution in order to enforce access via HTTPS only, and then Amazon Route 53 to configure the DNS settings 
													to serve the contents of the bucket using a custom domain name. In order to resolve a browser warning upon loading the site, I had to use the AWS 
													Certificate Manager to generate a custom SSL certificate for the custom domain name. At this point, I found that I had to include the 'https://www.' 
													prefix when trying to navigate to my site, but I overcame this by re-generating the SSL certificate for both the root domain and all its subdomains 
													through the use of a wildcard (e.g. *.domain.com), and re-configuring my CloudFront distribution to force access through HTTPS - a simple tickbox that I 
													had missed during the initial setup. 
												</p>
												<p>
													Now that I had my frontend served reliably over HTTPS using a custom domain name, I had to create a backend to store the value for a website view counter. 
													This led me to creating a Python-based Lambda to act as an API. This API would be called on website load to retrieve the value from within a DynamoDB table, 
													which was then displayed on the frontend using a small piece of JavaScript code.
												</p>

												<h4>CI/CD</h4>
												<p>This is the paragraph where I briefly talk about GitHub Actions. Technically this should've been done after Terraform, but I was making lots of small changes
													so it was useful to see these reflected as I was learning and it was so straight forward.
												</p>
												
												<h4>Transforming infrastructure into code</h4>
												<p>
													Having completed both the frontend and backend aspects of the proof of concept using the Amazon Web Console, the next step is to transform this infrastructure 
													into code, aptly named infrastructure-as-code (or IaC for short). I have chosen to learn Terraform in order to implement this, as it's a widely used 
													technology and will help my transition into a DevOps Engineering role in the future. 
												</p>
												<p>
													This project is still ongoing, albeit in its final stages, as I upskill in Terraform and slowly test my code in a separate repository to ensure it is 
													mirroring the infrastructure I have created already. While I am aware that there is an import feature within Terraform, I am trying to learn to make 
													the infrastructure from 'scratch' (and also using modules where it makes sense to).
