									managing of senior stakeholders as well as following an in-depth weekly reporting structure, leading to an 
									increased security posture of a critical cloud platform used by a national UK government department.
								</li>
								<li>
									Leveraged cybersecurity expertise to implement robust security practices using Terraform, Python and Bash, 
									overall reducing the external risk profile and improving security posture of the AWS platform. 
								</li>
								<li>
									Performed multiple gap analyses, aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (v1 and v2), across seven business
									units responsible for critical UK national infrastructure, in order to identify cybersecurity shortcomings and propose
									remedial security controls for both IT and OT systems. 
								</li>
								<li>

									etc.) to identify vulnerabilities within client's environments, calculating risk ratings by considering severity 
									and context.
								</li>
								<li>
									Reported findings along with effective remediation strategies, translating technical terms for non-technical
									senior stakeholders within debrief meetings
								</li>
